# apacheisisrestgui
This is replicating the [Company Index application](https://github.com/Jojs/springrest/blob/master/README.md)  
Here I quickly created a prototype within hours without really knowing the framework up front, while 70 hours
have gone into learning to built from scratch using Spring and AngularJS, etc. - and the Apache ISIS solution is 
still more functional than the 70 hour homebrew.

Run from IDE: https://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html
Comandline: https://isis.apache.org/guides/tg.html#_build_and_run

Apache ISIS is very interesting because it is efficient for prototyping but still will scale to a 100 concurrent users.  
It can also be extende and styled.  
It delivers both on GUI and REST API.
